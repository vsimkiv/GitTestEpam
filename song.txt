I am on an island, no one to confide
Eight days straight, eight hours each and not one line
I can feel pressure start to possess my mind
So, I'll take this beat I should delete to exercise

No, I move slow
I want to stop time
I'll sit here 'til I find the problem
No, I move slow
I want to stop time
I'll sit here 'til I find the problem

I've got a pet cheetah down in my basement
I've raised him, and bathed him
And named him Jason Statham
I've trained him to make me these beats
Now my pet cheetah's quicker in the studio than on his feet
